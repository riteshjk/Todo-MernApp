# Todo-MernApp

Welcome to the MERN Todo application! This is a full-stack web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It allows users to manage their todos efficiently with features such as adding, editing, deleting, and marking tasks as completed. Additionally, users can view detailed information about each task.

 # Features

   Add Todo: Users can easily add new todos to the list by entering a task description and pressing the add button.

   Edit Todo: Edit existing todos to update their descriptions or any other details as needed.

   Delete Todo: Remove unwanted todos from the list when they are no longer needed.

   View Detailed Information: Clicking on a specific task provides users with detailed information about that task, such as its creation date, deadline (if applicable), and any additional notes.

   Mark as Completed: Users can mark a task as completed with a single click. Once completed, the task is removed from the list, helping users keep their todo list organized.

# Technologies Used
MongoDB: Database to store todo data.
Express.js: Backend framework for handling server-side logic and API requests.
React.js: Frontend framework for building a dynamic and interactive user interface.
Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment for server-side code execution.
TailwindCss: styling languages for structuring and styling the application.
