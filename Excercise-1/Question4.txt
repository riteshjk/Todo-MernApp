- Explain why it will select those lines.
- Explain why it won't select other lines


***********************************************************************************************************************************************

Solution:

1 -  .box

    Elements selected: Lines 2, 6, 10
    Explanation: This selector selects all elements with the class "box" and there are 3 <div> Present which has class "box" so it target those three <div>.
    but lines 4 and 5 contain elements with different classes ("box-2" and no class), so they are not selected so the conslusion is (.) operator will talk to the
    class and wherever we use .box so we have to target that perticular class only thats why line number 2,6 and 10 will get targeted.


2 -  div .box

    Elements selected: Lines 2, 6
    Explanation: This selector selects all elements with the class "box" that are descendants of a <div> element descendants means the elements that are nested within other elements.
    and in given problem line number 2 and 6 and nested <div> fo parent div with class box thsts why it target those 2 lines.
    Other lines not selected: Line 10 is not a descendant of any <div> element, and Line 4 is a sibling of the <div> elements, not a descendant.


3 -  div.box

    Elements selected: Line 2,6,10
    Explanation: This selector selects the <div> element with the class "box" here we expect the div with class box not and child <div> or parent <div>.
    Other lines not selected: Line 4 is not selected because they don't have the "box" class in one element.


4 -  [class]

    Elements selected: Lines 2, 4, 6, 10
    Explanation: This selector selects all elements that have a class attribute and in given problem total 4 classes present to it directly target those 4 lines,
    when we want to target all the classes at same time we can do this.
    Other lines not selected: Line 5 doesn't have a class attribute so this div wont get targeted other than this wherever class is present that perticular line will get targeted.


5 -  #container .box

    Elements selected: Lines 2, 6
    Explanation: This selector selects all elements with the class "box" that are descendants of an element with the id "container".
    Other lines not selected: Lines 4 and 10 are not descendants of the element with the id "container".


6 -  #container > .box

    Elements selected: Line 2
    Explanation: This selector selects the element with the class "box" that is a direct child of an element with the id "container".
    Other lines not selected: Line 6 is not a direct child of the element with the id "container".
