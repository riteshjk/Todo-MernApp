***********************************************************************************************************************************************

Solution:

1 -  .box

    Elements selected: Lines 2, 6, 10
    Explanation: This selector selects all elements with the class "box" and there are 3 <div> Present which has class "box" so it target those three <div>.
    Other lines not selected: Lines 4 and 5 contain elements with different classes ("box-2" and no class), so they are not selected.


2 -  div .box

    Elements selected: Lines 2, 6
    Explanation: This selector selects all elements with the class "box" that are descendants of a <div> element.
    Other lines not selected: Line 10 is not a descendant of any <div> element, and Line 4 is a sibling of the <div> elements, not a descendant.


3 -  div.box

    Elements selected: Line 2,6,10
    Explanation: This selector selects the <div> element with the class "box".
    Other lines not selected: Line 4 is not selected because they don't have the "box" class in one element.


4 -  [class]

    Elements selected: Lines 2, 4, 6, 10
    Explanation: This selector selects all elements that have a class attribute.
    Other lines not selected: Line 8 doesn't have a class attribute.


5 -  #container .box

    Elements selected: Lines 2, 6
    Explanation: This selector selects all elements with the class "box" that are descendants of an element with the id "container".
    Other lines not selected: Lines 4 and 10 are not descendants of the element with the id "container".


6 -  #container > .box

    Elements selected: Line 2
    Explanation: This selector selects the element with the class "box" that is a direct child of an element with the id "container".
    Other lines not selected: Line 6 is not a direct child of the element with the id "container".
